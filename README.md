In the retail and sales domain, account managers, marketers, and sales teams need quick access to customer profiles, purchasing patterns, and product details to make informed, data-driven decisions. However, this data is often scattered across e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, and financial applications—making it challenging to consolidate and query effectively.

By combining Dremio’s unified data access with LangChain’s AI capabilities, you can build an AI customer sales assistant that enables:

- ✅ **Fast Retrieval of Records:** Seamlessly pull customer profiles—including order history and contact information—from multiple data sources.
- ✅ **Natural Language Queries:** Ask about product availability, recent purchases, or pending invoices in everyday language.
- ✅ **AI-Powered Insights:** Get recommendations for upselling or cross-selling opportunities based on historical sales data.

Hands-on Exercise


As a part of this hands-on exercise, the AI customer sales assistant will be able to:

- Fetch customer details using a unique customer ID
- Retrieve the latest purchase activity or outstanding invoices
- Provide a concise summary of purchase trends and top products

To support these capabilities, you'll define multiple LangChain tools that query Dremio for the necessary sales data—ensuring your AI agent can effortlessly surface real-time insights to drive revenue and strengthen customer relationships.
